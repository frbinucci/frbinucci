## Hi, I’m Francesco Binucci (aka **Dr. B**) 👋
 
I’m a **postdoctoral researcher** at the **National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications (CNIT)**, Italy. 🔬📡  
I earned my **Ph.D. in Industrial and Information Engineering** from the **University of Perugia (Italy)** in **April 2025** 🎓  
Right now I’m focusing on **goal-oriented communications** and **network optimization for edge inference** — trying to get the *right information* where it matters, fast. ⚡🧠

---

### 🔎 Research interests
- Goal-oriented / semantic communications 🧩
- Edge inference / edge intelligence 🧠📍
- Network optimization & resource allocation ⚙️📈
- Wireless & telecom systems 📶

---

### 💻 Dialects I use to convince computers
- **Python** 🐍 (prototyping, experiments, data/ML tooling)
- **MATLAB** 📊 (modeling, simulations, optimization)
- **C / C++** ⚡ (performance-oriented implementations)
- **Java** ☕ (coursework & projects)

---

### ✈️🧳🧱 Personal corner
When I’m not optimizing networks, you’ll probably find me:
- Looking at **airplanes** (and pretending I can identify them all) ✈️👀
- Planning or doing **trips** 🌍🧳
- Building **LEGO** constructions, one missing piece at a time 🧱🙂
